## NLP Projects (Autumn 2021, CS60075: Natural Language Processing)

Natural Language Processing projects in this repository:
1. **Language Modeling for sentence auto-completion:** Building language models for sentence auto-completion. Preprocessing text corpus, creating unigram, bigram and trigram language models, and using smoothed bigram and trigram to predict the next words in the sentence. Calculating perplexity scores.
2. **Named Entity Recognition using BERT:** Developing a Named Entity Recognition pipeline for sentences using a pre-trained BERT language model. NER data is split with train and validation, and the model is evaluated on the validation set.
3. **Sentiment Prediction using Naive Bayes and LSTM Classifier:** Classifying movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative using a Naive Bayes classifier and bidirectional LSTM based classifier. Stemming and Lematization is performed as preprocessing steps, and accuracy scores from both models are compared.
